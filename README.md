Base Liquidity Pool

📋 Project Description
Base Liquidity Pool is a decentralized liquidity provision protocol that enables users to contribute liquidity to various token pairs and earn trading fees. The protocol supports automated market making with dynamic pricing and risk management features.

🔧 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Solidity 0.8.0
Framework: Hardhat
Network: Base Network
Standards: ERC-20
Libraries: OpenZeppelin, Uniswap V2 Router

💰 Features
Core Functionality:
✅ Liquidity provision for token pairs
✅ Automated market making
✅ Fee distribution
✅ Liquidity withdrawal
✅ Dynamic pricing
✅ Risk management

Advanced Features:
Dual Token Pairs - Support for any two ERC-20 tokens
Automated Pricing - Constant product formula (x*y=k)
Fee Structure - Configurable trading fees
Liquidity Mining - Incentivized liquidity provision
Risk Controls - Slippage protection and price limits
Analytics Dashboard - Real-time pool performance
🛠️ Smart Contract Functions

Core Functions:
addLiquidity(address tokenA, address tokenB, uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB) - Add liquidity to pool
removeLiquidity(address tokenA, address tokenB, uint256 liquidityAmount) - Remove liquidity from pool
swap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amountIn, uint256 minAmountOut) - Execute token swap
getPoolInfo(address tokenA, address tokenB) - Get pool information
calculateLiquidityValue(address tokenA, address tokenB, uint256 liquidityAmount) - Calculate liquidity value

Events:
LiquidityAdded - Emitted when liquidity is added
LiquidityRemoved - Emitted when liquidity is removed
TokenSwapped - Emitted when token swap occurs
FeeCollected - Emitted when fees are collected
PoolCreated - Emitted when new pool is created


📊 Contract Structure
Pool Structure:
struct Pool {
    address tokenA;
    address tokenB;
    uint256 reserveA;
    uint256 reserveB;
    uint256 totalSupply;
    uint256 fee;
    uint256 lastUpdate;
}
Liquidity Position:
struct LiquidityPosition {
    uint256 amount;
    uint256 lastUpdate;
    uint256 earnedFees;
}
